# Iris Flower Prediction using Flask

A Flask-based web application for deploying a machine learning model that predicts the type of Iris flower based on sepal and petal dimensions. The application includes an interactive webpage built with HTML for user input.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model to predict the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on the following inputs:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Users can enter these values through a simple webpage, and the Flask backend processes the input using the ML model to provide predictions.

## Features

- Interactive HTML-based webpage for user input.
- Backend integration with Flask for serving the ML model.
- Real-time predictions of Iris flower species.
- Lightweight and user-friendly design.

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd iris-flower-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
2. Enter the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width in the form provided on the webpage.
3. Submit the form to receive the prediction of the Iris flower species.
